Panoptikum for Android - an audio interface to the acoustic web

Browsing the web is a fantastic experience, almost unlimited ressources like Wikipedia, Open Streatmap, newspapers, blogs or Youtube provide all of us with a vast amount of information and help us gain knowledge.

All of us? Not quite.
There is a quite significant part of the population that cannot use a web browser, for one reason or another. Might it be visual impairment, or might just be the keyboard + mouse + screen interface not a suitable option for the person in case.

Well, we have podcasts and the main repo of this organisation, is dedicated to the creation of https://panoptikum.io, a web interface to the vast amount of podcasts out there.

The aim of panodio is now to create a super easy to use audio interface the the hundred thousands of podcast episodes, that are now known by https://panoptikum.io.

The final goal is the following process:

* Switching on the device with a single key press
* Waiting for panodio to tell you, that it is now ready to serve you: <br/>
  *What can I play for you?*
* Telling panodio, what you would like to listen to next: <br/>
  *I would like to continue with the last episode of the Aua-Uff-Code podcast, that I listened to.*
* Listening to panodio

Stay tuned, we will follow up here, soon.
